# Admin Bar Plugin
ocws-admin-bar

This plugin inserts a menu on the Admin Bar, which provides links to the Old Castle Web Services website. This is for the convenience of clients of OCWS, and is placed here, in the Github repositories, to enable easy updating of the plugin, using Github Updater.

## Version 1.5
Earlier versions, not reported here, added extra menu items to the front-end admin bar. Now, some plugin-specific items have been added, that work with the Dewi2 theme. They will be gracefully ignored, if the relevant plugins (WooCommerce and Creation Caches) have not been installed.

## Version 1.2
Users added to the site name menu

## Version 1.0
The Wordpress logo replaced by the OCWS logo.

Plugins added to the site name menu

## Version 0.7
The original Admin bar plugin
