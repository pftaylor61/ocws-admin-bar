# Admin Bar Plugin
ocws-admin-bar

This plugin inserts a menu on the Admin Bar, which provides links to the Old Castle Web Services website. This is for the convenience of clients of OCWS, and is placed here, in the Github repositories, to enable easy updating of the plugin, using Github Updater.

## Version 1.9
Link added to front end for Timely Calendar Events

## Version 1.8
Conditional Link added for Backup Dashboard, if the Updraft is in place. This only works if the web developer is logged in

## Version 1.7
Link added to front end for posts

## Version 1.6
In this revision, the OCWS menu is removed from the front end, and placed into the drop-down title menu. Icons have also been added to the drop-down menus for both OCWS and the theme menu.

## Version 1.5.1
Tidied up a bit, by placing the new menu elements in a side menu, labeled with the them's name. Also menu items added for my Slider and Newsbox plugins - but, again, these will be ignored if the plugins are not present or activated.

## Version 1.5
Earlier versions, not reported here, added extra menu items to the front-end admin bar. Now, some plugin-specific items have been added, that work with the Dewi2 theme. They will be gracefully ignored, if the relevant plugins (WooCommerce and Creation Caches) have not been installed.

## Version 1.2
Users added to the site name menu

## Version 1.0
The Wordpress logo replaced by the OCWS logo.

Plugins added to the site name menu

## Version 0.7
The original Admin bar plugin
